  %h1.ui.header PocketBox is effortless file sharing optimized for debate
  %p PocketBox was created with the aim of making sharing speeches in debate rounds simple. With PocketBox, debate teams can focus on preparation and the round at hand, rather than on setting up clunky email chains. To use PocketBox, teams just have to enter a round name, and they immediately get a "room" and a code to share with other debaters, judges, or coaches. People participating in the round can upload files to the PocketBox room, and anyone can view or download the files uploaded.
  %h2.ui.header Upcoming Features
  %p Upcoming PocketBox features include user accounts, round report and win / loss tracking, and coach integration.
